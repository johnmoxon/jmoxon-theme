## Writing GPS

1. What is your business goal - care about what you’re writing - Motivating myself and other people to start something new.
2. Reframe - put your reader into it, ask “so what” repeatedly. Express your reframed idea + put this say the top. This is where you are headed - *So what? can people learn from my product journey and apply to their own projects* *My reader is involved in product management or product development, or they have a product or project they have in some state of initial progress. So what?* *They know they could achieve something, they are excited about the prospect, but something is stopping them - so what* *This article will propose simple steps and small changes to make sure that it gets done.*
3. Seek out data that backs up your main idea. Don’t discount your own experience -

   * Lean startups, what else?
   * Leader with no title
   * Lean Startup
   * Power of Habit
4. Organise. What structure helps communicate your point? Some options are a list, a how-to guide, and a client narrative. -

* A client narrative I think for this one, this will be a series and this is really the short setup.

1. Write to one person. Imagine the one person you’re helping and wrote to them. Use ‘you’ not they/people/them -

   * The one person is a product manager tasked with developing a successful product
2. Produce the first ugly draft. - show up and throw up. Hey the ideas out don’t worry about structure/spelling. Just get it down
3. Walk away. Give ideas time to mature. Preferably a day or more
4. Rewrite and reshape the mess. Swap places with your reader.
5. Give it a great headline. Make it irresistible
6. Have someone edit it\*\**
7. One final look for readability. Does it your inviting /easy to scan? Sorry paragraphs and bold subheads, lists bulleted/numbered. Avoid impenetrable chunky text
8. ## Publish but ask one more question. What next? Read more? Subscribe? But something? -->
